# Launch
Launch will be a Launcher3 Alternative for Android - a basic, no frills launcher, open source but 
decoupled from AOSP. Ideally this will make it simpler to maintain across Android versions, while 
providing a nice base launcher for others to fork and build upon.

Possibly. At the moment this is a playground for me to learn more about current day Android 
development and to experiment with how simple/difficult it would be to build an Android launcher.
